# Multilingual Text to Image Generator Chatbot

## Introduction

This project implements a Multilingual Text to Image Generator Chatbot using Streamlit, OpenAI's GPT-3.5, and Clarifai's image recognition API. The chatbot allows users to input text in their preferred language, which is then translated to English. The translated text serves as a prompt for the GPT-3.5 model to generate a response, which is subsequently used to generate an image related to the input text.
